A Simple HTTP server

An implementation of a HTTP server, which is built on top of the TCP server that was given as an example.
The HTTP server manages, accepts and handles HEAD, GET and POST requests. It displays the content,IP address and
the port of the client in a simple HTML 5 web page. It keeps a persistent connection if the
connection is of HTTP/1.1 and if the connection contains the keep-alive in the HEAD else it closes the connection.
The server can parse arguments and display on the web page, if the user goes to the requested page /color and
adds a query specifying the background color of the page the color of the page changes. We also implemented the main function
of the cookies as if you access localhost/port/colour it displays the last requested colour or just a white screen if nothing is in the
cookie.
The HTTP server supports parallel connections through the select() command.
Every request is logged into logfile.log.

The project went okay, most of the time went into figuring out and debuggin to get the parallel connection
going. We didn't have time to finish everything (Cookies and other headers) but managed to implement all
other tasks. The only thing we regret is we wished we had more time to complete the project.

Known bugs:
  Memory leak:
   There is a small leak that we can't figure out where it is coming from.

   Parallel connection not working completely:
   The tests that we implemented ourselves only allowed 5 connections at a time.

   Timeout maybe not working correctly:
   The time variable in the timeout is a little off. Didn't get the time to test it thoroughly.
